# FlaskRestApi
This repository is for learning basics of Flask Rest API 

First Rest API would convert Celcius to Farenheit and ViceVersa

I am using Mriguel Grinberg's post as a basis for this - https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/designing-a-restful-api-using-flask-restful
Also, I have Dockerized the Application for ease of distribution.
